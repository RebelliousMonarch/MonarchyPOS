MonarchyPOS is an in progress project as I learn more about fullstack software development. This is the official "Main" part of the program but it is not update as often because all prototyping and development is done in Python in another repository.

All prototypes and in-development features are available in my "prototyping" repository. 

Documentation for my processes and plans for this project is still being written, for now I am mainly using README's and comments.
